          Islam was popularized during the time of Prophet Muhammad (saws), or around the early to mid 600s CE. He was the last prophet of Islam, and is highly respected. He is invoked with the Arabic phrase "صَلَّى اللّٰهُ عَلَيْهِ وَسَلَّمَ", or "Sallalahu alaihi wasalam", translating to "Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him".

          Muslims believe in a second, eternal life, as do most religions. The outcome of the next life is dependent on one's character in this life. It is also dependent on how good of a Muslim he/she was. The afterlife has two possible outcomes: spending eternity in Jannah (Paradise) or Jahannam (Hell). Both Jannah and Jahannam have
